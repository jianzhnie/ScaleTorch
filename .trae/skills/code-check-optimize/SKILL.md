# Code Check and Optimize

When analyzing and improving code, perform the following actions:

1. **Fix any errors**: Identify and resolve syntax errors, logical bugs, and runtime issues.
2. **Add proper type hints**: Ensure all function arguments and return values have precise type annotations.
3. **Add documentation and comments**:
    - Add docstrings to modules, classes, and functions.
    - Add inline comments for complex logic.
4. **Improve code structure and readability**:
    - Refactor long functions.
    - Improve variable and function naming.
    - Ensure consistent formatting.
5. **Follow best practices and coding standards**:
    - Adhere to PEP 8 (for Python) or relevant style guides.
    - Use appropriate design patterns.
